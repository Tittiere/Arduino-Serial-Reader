# Arduino Serial Reader

Have you ever wanted to save your IoT project's data on a reliable desktop? Well, now you can. With Arduino Serial Reader you can read whatever you print on your arduino-like device and save it in a file on your desktop. The program automatically draws graphs and formats data to be excel-compatible.

(I started this project before having a GitHub account, so the first version of the program is 0.6.8. I'm going to rewrite it and publish the first official version of the code.)
